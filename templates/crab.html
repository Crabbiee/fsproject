<h2>General info</h2>
<p>Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura, which typically have a very short projecting "tail", usually hidden entirely under the thorax. They live in all the world's oceans, in fresh water, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, and have a single pair of pincers. They first appeared during the Jurassic Period.
</p>
<p>Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed primarily of highly mineralized chitin, and armed with a pair of chelae (claws). Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimeters wide, to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span up to 4 m (13 ft).[6] Several other groups of crustaceans with similar appearances - such as king crabs and porcelain crabs - are not true crabs, but have evolved features similar to true crabs through a process known as carcinisation.</p>

<h2>Lifespan</h2>
<p>Crabs have an average lifespan of 3 to 5 years, with some species living up to 30 years. The average lifespan of a crab is between three to five years. However, this greatly depends on the species of the crab. There are many different crab species, and their age ranges all vary.</p>
